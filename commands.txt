# The following commands are supported by all services:
[servicepath]/poll [pattern] [times (0|1|n)] [samplerate (optional)]
[servicepath]/stoppoll [pattern]
[servicepath]/pollsamplerate [pattern] [rate]
[servicepath]/setverbose [pattern] [1|0]
[servicepath]/filterresponse [pattern]

If no filter patterns are set then all responses are returned. 
Multiple filter patterns will match results on ANY of the patterns.
A filter pattern may contain wildcard character "*". Filters are applied
only at the address level (i.e. osc arguments are ignored)

If the "rate" argument is omitted from the poll command, the poll thread defaults to 30 samples per second.
If no "setverbose" command is sent, the default is "false".

Note that the following two commands are synonymous:
	/service/test/reader-writer/poll /my/test/osc/message 1
	/service/test/reader-writer/my/test/osc/message


Examples:

# Continuously poll using the command "/service/test/reader-writer/my/test/osc/message" at 30 fps
/service/test/reader-writer/poll /my/test/osc/message

# Continuously poll using the command "/service/test/reader-writer/my/test/osc/message 45" at 30 fps
/service/test/reader-writer/poll {/my/test/osc/message 45}

# Do a one-time read of the value of "/service/test/reader-writer/my/test/osc/message"
/service/test/reader-writer/poll /my/test/osc/message 1

# Poll 10 times using the command "/service/test/reader-writer/my/test/osc/message" at 30 fps
/service/test/reader-writer/poll /my/test/osc/message 10

# Poll unlimited number of times using the command "/service/test/reader-writer/my/test/osc/message" at 5 fps
/service/arduino/reader-writer/poll /my/test/osc/message 0 5

# Set the rate at which this client polls "/my/test/osc/message" to 20 samples per second
/service/test/reader-writer/pollsamplerate /my/test/osc/message 20

# Return all values matching "/my/test/osc/message" for the client, not just changed values
/service/test/reader-writer/setverbose /my/test/osc/message 1

# Return all values to the client
/service/test/reader-writer/setverbose /* 1

# Stop polling for the command "/service/arduino/reader-writer/my/test/osc/message"
/service/test/reader-writer/stoppoll /my/test/osc/message

# Return only results received matching my/test/osc/message to the client. This is only
# relevant when a wildcard has been used for the initial poll message.
/service/test/reader-writer/filterresponse /my/test/osc/message
