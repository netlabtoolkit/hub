# The following commands are supported by all services:
[servicepath]/poll [pattern] [times (0|1|n)] [samplerate (optional)]
[servicepath]/stoppoll [pattern]
[servicepath]/pollsamplerate [pattern] [rate]
[servicepath]/setverbose [pattern] [1|0]
[servicepath]/filterresponse [pattern]

If no filter patterns are set then all responses are returned. 
Multiple filter patterns will match results on ANY of the patterns.
A filter pattern may contain wildcard character "*". Filters are applied
only at the address level (i.e. osc arguments are ignored)

If the "rate" argument is omitted from the poll command, the poll thread defaults to 30 samples per second.
If no "setverbose" command is sent, the default is "false".

Examples:

# Continuously poll using the command "/service/test/reader-writer/analogin/3" at 30 fps
/service/test/reader-writer/poll /analogin/3

# Continuously poll using the command "/service/test/reader-writer/servo/3 45" at 30 fps
/service/test/reader-writer/poll {/servo/3 45}

# Do a one-time read of the value of "/service/test/reader-writer/analogin/3"
/service/test/reader-writer/poll /analogin/3 1

# Poll 10 times using the command "/service/test/reader-writer/analogin/3" at 30 fps
/service/test/reader-writer/poll /analogin/3 10

# Poll 10 times using the command "/service/test/reader-writer/analogin/3" at 5 fps
/service/arduino/reader-writer/poll /analogin/3 10 5

# Set the rate at which this client polls "/analogin/3" to 20 samples per second
/service/test/reader-writer/pollsamplerate /analogin/3 20

# Return all values matching "/analogin/3" for this client
/service/test/reader-writer/setverbose /analogin/3 1

# Return all values to this client
/service/test/reader-writer/setverbose /* 1

# Stop polling for the command "/service/arduino/reader-writer/test/3"
/service/test/reader-writer/stoppoll /analogin/3

# Return only results received from analog input 3 to the client
/service/test/reader-writer/filterresponse /analogin/3

# Return only results received from any analog input to the client
/service/test/reader-writer/filterresponse /analogin/*


Note that the following two commands are synonymous:
/service/test/reader-writer/poll /analogin/3 1
/service/test/reader-writer/analogin/3
