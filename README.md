NETLab Hub
==========

This is the official source code and libraries for the NETLab Hub, 
part of the [NETLab Toolkit](http://netlabtoolkit.org) project.

Documentation can be found [in the Wiki on this site](https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/hub/wiki).

You can report bugs under the [“issues” tab](https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/hub/issues). Our team is very small and 
this work is uncompensated, so please be patient. We welcome suggestions for new features.

The NETLab Hub has a very simple API for plugin development. Documentation will follow shortly.

This is free software. See the [license.txt](https://github.com/netlabtoolkit/hub/blob/master/license.txt) file for license details.
