<!DOCTYPE Services>

	<!-- 
	You can use this file to define custom services using existing classes.
	By using existing plug-ins and filters you can create complex functionality.
	
	Services can be defined as new implementation of a specific service class
	or by extending an existing service defined in another configuration file.
	Extended services will inherit all of the startup messages and output filters
	of the parent service. Elements defined in a child service will override all
	elements of that type in the parent service.
	
	The base path for all services defined here will be /service/custom/[servicename]
	 
	IMPORTANT: you should backup and restore this file whenever you install 
	an upgrade to the Hub software.
